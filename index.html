			<h2>Who are we ...</h2>
			<p>TTF was founded in 1894. Our founder, Angela Farnham started selling clothes pegs and 
			this paved the way for push-on style of clothes pegs.</p>
			
			<p> TTF are committed to delivering high-quality textile fasteners for making housework more convenient. 
			These fasteners are based on the hinged peg design which are made entirely of metal and not of cheap plastic.
